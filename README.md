This app is called Monty. The user has to guess which card is
the ace. On "New Game" and app launch all cards are face-down, the Winner/
Loser image is hidden. Once the user taps a card it reveals an ace or
blank. This in turn causes the Winner/Loser message appear. Taps on
the screen from this point on are ignored until the user taps "New
Game" again.
